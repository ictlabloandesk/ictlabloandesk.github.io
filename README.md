# ICT Lab Loan Desk

Inventory and equipment loan register for the ICT Laboratory at Karelia University of Applied Sciences.
It keeps track of the lab's devices, records who has borrowed what, produces the paper loan record for signing, and helps check equipment back in.

**Live site:** https://ictlabloandesk.github.io/

## Features

### Inventory
- Add devices with name, category, serial / asset number, amount in stock and notes.
- Change stock amounts straight in the table (− / + or type a number). Stock can't go below what is on loan.
- All number boxes use − / + buttons and only accept whole numbers; negative numbers can't be entered.
- Edit or delete devices. A device can't be deleted while some of it is on loan.
- See for every device how many are **in stock**, **on loan** and **available**.
- **Search** by name, category, serial number or notes.
- **Advanced search**: filter by category (including "No category"), by availability (available, none available, some on loan), and choose which field the search text looks in. **Close** hides the panel; the filters stay on until **Clear filters**.
- **Sort by** (default name A–Z): newest added, oldest added, recently modified, name A–Z / Z–A, category, most / least available, most in stock, most on loan. The choice is remembered.
- **Manage categories**: rename or remove a category. All devices in it are updated. Renaming into an existing category merges the two.
- Click a category in the table to show only that category.
- **Bar above the table**:
  - **Select** shows a checkbox on every device. The bar then offers **Select all** (every device shown, works with search and filters) and **Deselect**. When everything is selected, only **Deselect all** is shown. Deselect / Deselect all clear the selection and hide the checkboxes.
  - **Export to Excel**: with nothing selected, exports every device shown in the list; with a selection, only the selected devices.
  - **Delete** (bin icon, appears when something is selected): deletes the selected devices after a confirmation. Devices with units on loan are kept.

### New loan
- Fields: Name and Email (or phone) of the borrower, Group, Course, Start date, End date and Notes (not printed).
- **+ Add member** adds more borrowers for a project group: just a name (with the same name suggestions); the one email above is enough for the loan. All names are printed on the loan record, everyone is added to the borrower list and the loan page lists all members. Use × to remove a member row.
- **Name and email suggestions**: start typing a name, an email or a student number. Matching people are listed: those who borrowed before first (marked "borrowed 2×" and so on), then everyone else on the borrower list. To add many people at once, add them to `borrowers.json` in the data repository. Use the mouse, or ↓ / ↑ and Enter. Picking one fills in the name and email, and the group and course if they are empty.
- **New borrowers are added automatically**: when a loan is saved for a name or email that is not on the borrower list yet, that person is added (marked as "added"). For people already on the list, the latest group, course and contact are kept.
- **Remove someone from the borrower list**: press the **×** next to a name in the suggestions (or highlight it with ↓ / ↑ and press Delete), then **Remove**. Their loans are kept; the removal is listed on the History page. Importing a list again brings them back if they are in it.
- **Group suggestions**: click the Group box to see ICNS23, ICNS24, ICNS25, ICNS26 and TITE/ICT Program Team, or type to filter. Other groups typed in earlier loans are suggested too.
- **Course suggestions**: type a course name or code (for example "iot" or "IC10028") to pick a course from the ICT curriculum. Courses typed in earlier loans are suggested too.
- Dates are written as **dd.mm.yyyy** (5.11.2026, 05.11.26, 5/11/2026 and 5,11,2026 also work); the calendar button next to each date opens a date picker.
- **No fixed return date**: tick it under End date when there is no known return date. The loan then has no due date, is never shown as overdue, and the loan record, loan page and email say "No fixed date". A request form with an empty End Date ticks it automatically.
- The end date can't be before the start date. Moving the start date past the end date moves the end date to two weeks after the start.
- Pick devices from the inventory with number and serial number. You can't lend more than is available.
- **Device search**: type part of a device name, category or serial number in the Device/Component box, or click it to see every device with how many are available. Devices with none available can't be picked.
- In the list of added devices, change the number with **− / +** (up to what is available), **Edit** the serial number, or **Remove** the line.
- **Fill from request form** (top right): upload a filled-in copy of the lab's "ICT Laboratory Equipment Loan Request Form" (Excel). The form is filled in for you: Full Name, Group, Course, Email, Start and End date, the teacher (into Notes) and the devices with serial numbers and numbers. Devices are matched to the inventory by name, even when written a little differently, and limited to what is available. Several names in Full Name (separated by commas, "and" or new lines) become separate members. The Email row is used as the loan's email; if it is empty, the first person's email is taken from the borrower list. A summary shows what was added, which devices were not found or not available, and anything else to check. Nothing is saved until you press **Save loan**; the normal way of creating a loan is unchanged.
- After saving: **Download PDF**, **Download Excel**, **Print** or **Email to borrower**.

### Loan record (PDF / Excel / Print)
- Same layout as the paper "ICT Laboratory Equipment Loan Record" (A4 landscape, 10 item lines, signature boxes left blank for signing).
- Loans with more than 10 items continue on a second page.
- **Print** opens the PDF with the print dialog. Allow pop-ups for the site if the browser blocks it.

### Email to borrower
- Uses the email address in the loan's **Contact** field (an email and a phone number can be written together).
- Downloads the Excel loan record and opens your email app with recipient, subject and a message listing the equipment and return date already filled in. Attach the downloaded file and press Send.
- Loans without an email show **Add email** in the Loans page.

### Loans and returns
- Tabs for **Out now**, **Overdue**, **Returned** and **All**, plus search by name, group, course, device or serial.
- Open a loan to download, print or email its record again.
- **Return check**: enter how many of each item came back, or use **All back** / **Mark everything back**. Partial returns keep the loan open and show what is still missing. When everything is back the loan closes and the equipment counts as available again.
- Return notes for damage, missing cables and so on.

### History
- The **History** page lists every change: devices added, edited, deleted or restocked, loans created, return checks, returns, contact changes and deleted loans, with date, time and who did it.
- Columns: **Timestamp**, **User**, **Action** and **Description**.
- Search the history, or show only inventory or only loan changes.
- **Export to Excel**: with nothing selected, exports every entry that matches the search and filter; with a selection, only the selected entries. The file has Timestamp, User, Category, Action and Description columns with filters.
- **Select** shows a checkbox on every entry; **Select all** picks every entry that matches the search and filter. **Delete** (bin icon) removes the selected entries from `history.json` after a confirmation. The data repository's commit list still keeps an older copy.

### Save folder
- In Chrome and Edge, the **Save folder** button at the bottom of the sidebar lets you choose a folder once (for example **DocumentsICT Loan Desk**). From then on every PDF and Excel export (loan records, inventory, history, the file for Email to borrower) is saved straight into that folder instead of Downloads. Files are never overwritten: a second copy gets "(2)" and so on.
- The choice is kept in that browser. After the browser restarts it may ask once for permission to save in the folder; choose **Allow**.
- **Use Downloads instead** goes back to normal downloads. Other browsers (Firefox, Safari) always use normal downloads.

### General
- Sidebar with lab totals: units in stock, out on loan, available now and overdue loans.
- Karelia green theme with **Light**, **Dark** and **Auto** modes (button at the bottom of the sidebar).
- Works on phones and narrow windows.

## Where the data is stored

This repository only holds the app (and `users.json`, see Users below). **No student, loan or inventory data is stored here.** It is safe for this repository to be public:
visitors without a login can't see or change any data.

The app saves its data in a separate **private** repository (`ictlabloandesk/ict-lab-loan-data`), one file per kind of data.
Each change is one commit that only touches the files it changed:

| File | What it holds |
| --- | --- |
| `inventory.json` | Devices and components, one per line, A–Z. |
| `loans.json` | Loan records, newest first, one per line. |
| `borrowers.json` | Students and staff: the imported student and staff list (`"source":"imported"`) and everyone typed into a loan who wasn't on the list (`"source":"added"`). Name, email, username, group, course. Used for the suggestions in New loan. |
| `history.json` | Every change, newest first, one line per change (date, who, what). This is what the History page shows. |

The files are created automatically when first needed.
Older versions of the app kept inventory and loans together in `data.json` (and borrowers in `people.json` / `directory.json`). The first time the new version opens such a repository it moves everything into the new files and removes the old ones, in one commit.
The borrower list holds personal data, so it is only ever saved in the private data repository, never in this public one.
The commit list of the data repository is also a full record of who changed what and when.

### Connecting a browser (owner)

1. Create a fine-grained personal access token at <https://github.com/settings/personal-access-tokens/new>:
   - Resource owner: **ictlabloandesk** (the organisation, not your personal account).
   - Repository access: **Only select repositories**, then choose `ict-lab-loan-data` (and `ictlabloandesk.github.io` if you use user logins, see below).
   - Repository permissions: **Contents: Read and write**.
2. Open the site, press **Set up GitHub storage** (or **Connect with your GitHub token** on the Sign in screen), paste the token and press **Connect**.
3. The status at the bottom of the sidebar should say **Saved to GitHub**.

The token is kept in that browser only. Do this once on each computer you use.

### Users (username and password logins)

One or two users can use the app in the owner's absence with a username and password. They don't need a GitHub account or token.
Users can use the whole app: inventory, loans and return checks. They can't manage users. Every change they save shows their username.

**One-time setup (owner):**
1. Edit your own token at <https://github.com/settings/personal-access-tokens> and add the repository **`ictlabloandesk.github.io`** (Contents: Read and write), so the app can save the list of users.
2. Create a **second** fine-grained token just for users, for example "Loan desk users", at <https://github.com/settings/personal-access-tokens/new>:
   - Resource owner: **ictlabloandesk**.
   - Repository access: **Only select repositories**, then **`ict-lab-loan-data` only**.
   - Repository permissions: **Contents: Read and write**.
   - Don't use your own token for this. The user token can't touch the website.
3. In the app, press **Users** at the bottom of the sidebar, paste the user token and press **Save user token**.

**Adding, changing and removing users:** in the **Users** panel, add a username and a password (at least 12 characters), give **New password**, or **Remove**. Changes reach the website in about a minute.

**How users use it:** open the site, enter username and password, press **Sign in**. "Keep me signed in on this computer" keeps them signed in after the browser is closed; leave it off on shared computers. **Sign out** is under the status button at the bottom of the sidebar.

**Who did what:** every change is saved with the name of the person who made it ("· by anna" in the data repository history), and each loan shows **Lent by** and **Checked by**.

**How it works:** `users.json` in this repository holds, for each user, the user token encrypted with a key made from that user's password (PBKDF2-SHA256, 600 000 rounds, AES-GCM). The plain user token is only kept in the owner's browser.

**If you no longer trust a user:** remove them, then on GitHub delete the user token and create a new one, paste it under **Users → Replace it**, and give the remaining users a **New password**.

### Keeping the data safe
- Never share the token or put it in this repository.
- On shared or lab computers, press the storage status button and choose **Disconnect this browser** when you are done.
- If a token may have leaked, delete it at <https://github.com/settings/personal-access-tokens> and create a new one.
- When the token expires, the app shows an error. Create a new token and paste it in the same panel.

Without a token the app still works, but saves only in that browser.

## Editing the app

| File | What it is |
| --- | --- |
| `loan-desk.html` | The app source: layout, styles and code in one file. Edit this one. |
| `index.html` | The page GitHub Pages serves. Generated from `loan-desk.html`, don't edit by hand. |
| `build.mjs` | Builds `index.html` from `loan-desk.html`. |
| `karelia-logo.png` | Logo shown in the sidebar. |
| `users.json` | User logins (encrypted). Written by the app from the Users panel; don't edit by hand. Run `git pull` before pushing your own changes. |

After changing `loan-desk.html`, rebuild and commit both files (needs [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)):

```bash
node build.mjs
```

```bash
git add loan-desk.html index.html
git commit -m "Describe the change"
git push
```

GitHub Pages updates the live site about a minute after the push. Press Ctrl+F5 in the browser to see the new version.

The app uses [jsPDF](https://github.com/parallax/jsPDF) for PDF files and [ExcelJS](https://github.com/exceljs/exceljs) for Excel files, loaded from cdnjs.
